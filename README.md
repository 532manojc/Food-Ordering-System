## üéØ Project Motivation

I built this project to deepen my understanding of how a complete web application works‚Äîfrom front-end design to back-end data handling. Through this project, I learned how to structure and style content, manage data with MySQL, and create an admin dashboard for efficient site management. My goal was to provide users with a smooth and intuitive food ordering experience while ensuring the system remains easy to manage from the backend.
